The hardware-in-the-loop network emulator allows programmable control of the network condition and topology, i.e. the transmission power of the 5G small cell, the number of vehicles connected to a network. Impact of the variable network conditions on vehicular services (i.e. video streaming) can be measured and analyzed in a realistic way.
